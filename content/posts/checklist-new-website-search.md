### Search

Search is a crucial element of any website, but depending on the tool being used can be a difficult fit with Agile development process. If the search tool has a limited feature set then this can be a blocker mid way through development forcing the adoption of a new tool.

Some useful questions to ask;

1. How complex are the features required, over the development of the site? Will the chosen tool provide all these features? 
2. Any special features required such as Result Count?
3. What are the performance requirements for search?
4. What Data is required? Where is it coming from? How often does it change? Can the search index be added to or does a rebuild involve search downtime.
