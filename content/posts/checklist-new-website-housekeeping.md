### Housekeeping & Maintenance

Making sure a website self manages is very important to maintain performance and up time. Automatically clearing out working data and archiving ensures a clean and performant database. An extra consideration is there is a storage cost when using cloud hosting, so managing the data in expensive storage and putting other data in cheaper storage can help with the cost of running a cloud app.

Some questions worth asking;

1. Which data can be archived and when? Will users require access of can it be offloaded to cheaper storage.
2. What Logging Levels are required for who long and retention? Can logs be aggregated and put into cheaper storage
3. What happens to Inactive users and associated data? Can accounts be automatically expired and removed?
