Some of the Big Hitters to check when starting a new website project

### Images

Images are crucial for any modern website, but I have sometimes found the process for managing the images and matching to content on the website can be overlooked. Some questions I always try and ask in the early stages of a new website project are;

Where are images sourced from, is there an image management tool or are they manually uploaded? How will the images be refreshed? If they are being sourced from an external source what is the latency and can then by loaded into a CDN?

Matching up to the content - How will the images be matched to the location in the content, multiple product images for example. Can a naming convention be used and how should a missing image be handled gracefully?

Size and Optimisation - What format will the images be supplied in, do they need to be resized or optimised automatically automatically? Can a convention be put in place to size multiple images.
