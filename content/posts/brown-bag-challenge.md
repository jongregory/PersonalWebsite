Brown Bag sessions are something which are encouraged where I work, these are lunchtime presentations which anyone can set up and can be on any topic. The term refers to the informal nature of the presentation that attendees can bring there lunch along hence brown bag.

I wanted to challenge myself to do a brown bag a month for a year so I could get into the cycle of learning and presenting new technologies that I was interested in. Realistically I won't always be able to achieve this with work load and home life but if the theory is if it becomes habitual to present a technology I am reading about I will cover it in more detail and identify gaps in my knowledge.

The list so far is;

1. Agile software Diagrams with the C4 Model
2. Building Static Website with Hugo and Netlify
3. Continuous Inspection with SonarQube
4. Introduction to Ethical Hacking
5. Introduction to Azure Cognitive Services
6. Azure Machine Learning
7. Azure Bot Framework
8. Quantum Computing (Geek Out)


The amount of effort of these presentations depends on my level of knowledge, some are topics I have been working on for a while so can stand up and bore for ages on them, others are completely new to me and the brown bag becomes a useful vehicle for consolidating the research.

If this goes well I will extend with new topics to keep a regular cycle of CPD work.
