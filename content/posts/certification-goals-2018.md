Last year I found setting myself a target or achieving MCSD and MCSE Microsoft Certifications really helped me to focus the limited self study time I had available.

So for 2018 I am going to push myself a little bit more this year and set the following goals;

***Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator*** - I spent many years working on Unix and Oracle, but my skills are pretty rusty. When I bought the Azure triple voucher last year it came with a voucher for the Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator. So using resources on the [Linux Academy](https://linuxacademy.com/) I am studting towards Linux System Administrator. This combines with [Exam 70-533 Azure Infrastructure](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-533.aspx) to get [MCSA Linux on Azure certification
](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/mcsa-linux-azure-certification.aspx)


***EC Certified Ethical Hacker*** - cyber security is increasingly in the public eye, and the accessability of hacking tools means its very easy for anyone to attack a site. With that in mind I have added [Ethical Hacking Certification](https://www.eccouncil.org/programs/certified-ethical-hacker-ceh/) to my learning path.


***AWS Certifiction*** - to partner my Azure certificaton I want to achieve the AWS architecture and Devops certifications. These are likely to be harder for me as I am not exposed to AWS reguarly;

* [AWS Solution Architect Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/)
* [AWS Solution Architect Professional](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-professional/)
* [AWS Certified SysOps Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-sysops-admin-associate/)
* [AWS Certified Devops Professional](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-devops-engineer-professional/)

***MCSE Data and Analytics*** - I am a real interest in Big Data and Machine Learning, the following three exams provide a MCSE data certification. They are new exams and there is not too many resources available for them at the time of writing. As I come across resources I am collecting them, but its going to be a challenge to get these passed in 2018!

* [70-773 Analyzing Big Data with Microsoft R](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-773.aspx)
* [70-774 Perform Cloud Data Science with Azure Machine Learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-774.aspx)
* [70-775 Perform Data Engineering on Microsoft HD Insight](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-775.aspx)
