2018 wasn't a successful year for my CPD certifications , I did do a lot of work around the Azure Cognitive Services but no exams, so 2019 is a reboot to build up my certifications.

I am going to try an approach this with some high level goals in each quarter, and this post is more a record for December 2019 Jon to remember what I wanted to achieve!

## Q1 – Q2 Machine Learning and Data Science ##

I am very interested in getting a good grounding in Data Science and in particular using the machine learning tools in application development, there three tracks I have planned;
 
**Machine Learning Track;**
 

The [https://aischool.microsoft.com](Microsoft AISchool) has some great free training courses available;

This course offers a certification from Stanford  - [https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning]()
 
 
**Python Track;**

Learning Python and /or R is a requirement understanding a lot of data science, and will help with some of the planned AWS work latter in the year;

- [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-98-381.aspx](MS Python Exam)
 
**Data Science;**

Data Science is a vast and complex field, I really am aiming just to get a foundation level knowledge so I can start to build on it later on;

## Q3 – Q4 Cloud Architecture ##

The second half of the year I would like to focus on broadening my cloud architecture knowledge with the AWS and GCP architect tracks, and update my Azure certifications to the new AZ role based exams.

There are so many courses out there for these topics, and they change so regularly that I am going to wait until nearer the time to select them.
 
**AWS Architect Track;**
