Last week I took the [EC-Council Certified Ethical Hacker](https://www.eccouncil.org/programs/certified-ethical-hacker-ceh/) exam, this post is a quick write up of the experience and the resources used.

I chose this exam as it is popular choice for an overview of Cyber Security and Ethical Hacking,and is well recognised. The exam syllabus covers the definition of ethical hacking, the processes and some of the tooling used.

Its a difficult exam at four hours long with 125 questions over a broad range of topics. I reviewed a lot of material and there was still a couple of questions which I had not studied for.

The exam is expensive with resit cost being slighlty lower, the [recommendation](https://cert.eccouncil.org/application-process-eligibility.html#ceh) is to attend official training which supplies an exam voucher. The EC-Council course material consists of 18 modules at around 150 pages each so a course really helps navigate this content and highlight the important areas. There are also course labs which are hands on with the various hacking tools covered, having an instructor on hand to resolve questions with these tools was very useful. I did my course with [QA Certified Ethical Hacker Course](https://www.qa.com/hot-topics/cyber-security/vendor-specific-courses/ec-council/ethical-hacker-v9#course-details "QA Certified Ethical Hacker Course").

## Resource Used ##

After the course I didn't feel comfortable I had digested all the required information, so I reviewed all the course notes again into revision notes and also used the following practice resources;

- [Udemy Practice Exams - Jason Dion ](https://www.udemy.com/ethicalhacker/learn/v4/overview)
- [CEH v9 Practice Test - Raymond Blockman](https://www.amazon.co.uk/CEH-v9-Certified-Ethical-Practice/dp/1119252156?SubscriptionId=AKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q&tag=duc08-21&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1119252156 "CEH v9 Practice Test Raymond Blockman")
- [CEH Certified Ethical Hacker Practice Exams - Matt Walker](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Certified-Ethical-Hacker-Practice-Exams/dp/1259836606/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1520247327&sr=1-4&keywords=CEH++Matt+Walker&dpID=51e858WQCRL&preST=_SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch "CEH Certified Ethical Hacker Practice Exams - Matt Walker") 
- Cheat Sheets - we where given a good one on the course, there are quite a few on the web, these helped with the area that needed to be memorised for the exam.  
 

The course material is protected pdfs which are coded to include you name, and you get three computer licences, one of which was used on the course training PC. Its is worth considering this when deciding where to host your notes and how long you will have access to that computer.

## Hints & Tips ##

1. Its US based course so the material and questions have a US focus
2. There is a wide variation in the difficulty of the questions, so much so that I found myself doubting the answer looking for the catch in the easy questions.
3. The question structure is different style to the Microsoft Exams I am used to, quite often in the practice tests if the questions seemed the sensible choice it was usually correct.
4. The subject area is broad, if you are from an application background you need to learn about basic networking and CIDR rules.
5. Do as many practice tests as you can to get comfortable with the subject range.
6. There are a lot of hacking tools, create a summary of tool of each tool mentioned and its purpose. And learn NMap and its options as it is one for the primary hacking tools on the course.
. In the two weeks before the exam I created a daily exercise sheet for key areas I needed to memorise, these included the Binary, Hex and Oct conversions, Acronyms to learn and tool switches and encryption types and the key size.


## Takeaways ##

I really enjoyed this course and was surprised at the amount of non technical activities that surround the hacking process. Its very interesting to get hands on with the various hacking tools available and how they could be used to Pen Testing during the development process. 

It is scary to see the amount of control which be gained in a successful hack although it does require a vulnerability to be present, so it reminded me of the importance of applying updates and encrypting everything.

For myself this course has been a great introduction to topic of Cyber Security, the process and the tools available. I understand the potential threats to an application and the importance of making sure sites are tested for security regularly and vulnerabilities identified.

The one advantage the hacker has is time, they can sit and repeatedly analyses a site for weaknesses for as long as they want. The hacker only has to be right once the security needs to be right all the time.
