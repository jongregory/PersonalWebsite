### Migration

When a new site is being built it is more than often replacing an existing site. This site could possibly have user information, content, order history etc that users will expect to be in place when the use the new site.

Some questions to ask during planning;

* Is there an existing site? what is the state of the data? Its there in interface or api to get the data in an out?
* Is the user being imported? Do passwords meet the new security standards? Will the hashing or encryption support migration? 
* Will user have to re-register on first login or reset password?
* Is user / order history being imported? How much historical data should be brought across? Can a archived data service be used to display historical information to the user?
* Go-live approach will it be big bang or parallel running? does data have to be synchronised between the incumbent and replacement systems and for how long?
