## What are Azure Cognitive Services?

[Azure Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/) are a set of consumable tools which make Cognitive AI functions available to a wider audience. This means websites and applications can be augmented with cognitive AI tooling for more advanced communication with users. 

Cognitive Services are one third of the [Microsoft AI Platform](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/ai-platform/) suite of AI services, the others being Machine Learning Services and BOT Framework.

By providing a set of API's and Dashboard Portals Microsoft have abstracted the  complexity of AI functionality and brought it within the scope of small to medium projects.

There are five main Cognitive Services available;

1. [Vision](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/directory/vision/) - a set of services to process and extract data from images, including Face and Emotion recognition, Content Moderation and Image/Video Indexing
2. [Knowledge](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/directory/know/) - tooling for experience learning, recommendation engines and enhanced BOTS.
3. [Language](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/directory/lang/) - Natural Language Processing with LUIS, Text Analytics and Translation Services
4. [Speech](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/directory/speech/) - Tooling for Speech Recognition and Instant Translations.
5. [Search](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/directory/speech/) - Enhanced Search tooling powered by the BING search engine.

This post explores the cognitive services available and how they could be used to enhance new or existing websites, opening up new possibilities for communicating with users.

Equally as exciting and with some overlap is the [Machine Learning Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning-services/) provided by Microsoft, these can be used in conjunction with the [Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/) to provide powerful solutions. So they will be mentioned in this post but I plan to produce a dedicated post covering Machine Learning Services in more detail.

## How do I use Cognitive Services?

The major benefit of the Azure Cognitive services is the ease of use and integration into applications. They can be used with a mix of the Azure Portal for setup and configuration with REST API and JSON payload or SDK to interact with the service. 

Depending upon the service, LUIS the Language Understanding and Intelligence Service for instance, requires setup of example data and training to learn the data.

Each service has a getting started guide in the docs and there is a [AI Services Workshop](https://github.com/martinkearn/AI-Services-Workshop) GitHub library with samples and instructions.


## What can I do with Cognitive Services?

This is the really exciting part of Azure Cognitive Services, they open up the possibilities for applications to interact with users beyond the traditional keyboard approach.

<expand this which each of the services and what could be done>

### Vision ###

Content Moderation, and indexing is possible with the Image services for applications where the users are providing images or content.

### Knowledge ###

### Language ###

Creating BOTS backed by Natural Language can enable more fluid communication and understanding of complexities of questions users sometimes ask. As the models are developed and trained the services can route to the required content or products more accurately.

### Speech ###

Speech interaction opens up new opportunities with accessibility or localisation, allowing users to talk to you website or application in the language of their choice is very powerful. Partially sighted of blind users could use speech and text reader to access the services they require.

Imagine a Business MI application enhanced by using speech or bots to access KPI or summary performance data. Used in conjunction with an MI tool important information could be accessed and analysed far quicker.

### Search ###

????

Spell checkers
Automatic Lookups
Querying tools


### Combinations ###

The real power comes form combining these services to work together to provide powerful interactions and learning. Many of the services are using Machine Learning behind the scenes , but can also be combined with additional machine learning services to drive improved interactions.



## Conclusion

The AI Platform and Azure Cognitive services offer web and application developers affordable access to complex and advanced AI services. Adding Cognitive Services to an application or website opens up multiple channels of communication with users which improves as the services learn.

Applications of any kind can benefit from improved communication with the users, reduced administration of content, more intelligent targeting of information and up-selling and 'learning' users behaviour.

The use cases opened up by Cognitive Services as vast and application development in the coming years will be transformed as they enter more mainstream usage. The key benefit is accessibility and affordability of complex AI services which previously not been possible.
