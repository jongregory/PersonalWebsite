## What are Azure Cognitive Services?

[Azure Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/) are a set of consumable tools which make Cognitive AI functions available to a wider audience. This means website can augmented with AI tooling for communication with more widely available development skill sets. 

Cognitive Services are one third of the [Microsoft AI Platform](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/ai-platform/)

By providing a set of API's and Dashboard Portals Microsoft have abstracted the  complexity of AI functionality and brought it within the scope of small to medium projects.

There are five main features available;

1. [Vision](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/directory/vision/) - a set of services to process and extract data from images, including Face and Emotion recognition, Content Moderation and Image/Video Indexing
2. [Knowledge](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/directory/know/) - tooling for experience learning, recommendation engines and enhances BOTS.
3. [Language](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/directory/lang/) - Natural Language Processing with LUIS, Text Analytics and Translation Services
4. [Speech](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/directory/speech/) - Tooling for Speech Recognition and Instant Translations.
5. [Search](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/directory/speech/) - Enhanced Search tooling powered by the BING search engine.

This post explores which cognitive services available and how they could be used to enhance new or existing websites, opening up new possibilities for communicating with users.

Equally as exciting and with some overlap is the [Machine Learning Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning-services/) provided by Microsoft, these can be used in conjunction with the [Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/) to provide powerful solutions. So they will be mentioned in this post but I plan to produce a dedicated post covering Machine Learning Services in more detail.
