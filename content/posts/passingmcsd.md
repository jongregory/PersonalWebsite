### Certification Update

I last got some Microsoft certifications in 2008 which were based in ASP.Net forms and ADO.Net on .Net 3.5. So I was long overdue and update, the microsoft certifications change reguarly so its worth keeping an eye on the overview page [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/certification-overview.aspx](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/certification-overview.aspx)

I set myself the goal of achieving MCSD App Builder and MCSE Azure Cloud and Infrastructure, this can be achieved with five exams.

1. [70-483 Programming C#](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-483.aspx)
2. [70-486 Developing ASP.NET MVC Applications](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-486.aspx)
3. [70-532 Developing Microsoft Azure Solutions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-532.aspx)

Passing these three exams achieves [MCSD App Builder](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/mcsd-app-builder-certification.aspx). Exam 532 also counts as one of the exams for [MCSE Cloud and Platform Infrastructure](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/mcse-cloud-platform-infrastructure.aspx) so just more additional exams are then required;

1. [70-533 Implementing Azure Infrastructure Solutions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-533.aspx)
2. [70-534 Architecting Microsoft Azure Solutions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/learning/exam-70-534.aspx)

Note 70-534 is being retired and I took it in the last month of availability, it is being replaced with [70-535 Architecting Microsoft Azure Solutions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-535.aspx) which has about 30% new content.

### General Exam Tips

Here are a few tips I picked up along the way

* Try and use at least three training resources per exam, one should be the Microsoft or Azure Docs
* Each exam gives you a piece of paper, you can use this to brain dump any info at the start of the exam

*Expand from evernote*

### [70-483 Programming C# Resources](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-483.aspx) 

If you have been working on C# for while then this exam will cover a lot of familiar concepts, the two area I found were tricky were subjects that I don't use in everyday coding and some answers are for the Microsoft recommended way not necessarily the industry best practice.

For this exam I managed to pass using these resources;

* link to MVA course
* link to book
* link to MSDN
