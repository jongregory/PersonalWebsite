I attended the Certified Scrum Product Owner course this month run by [Agil8](https://www.agil8.com/ "Agil8").

To be honest I was a bit sceptical as have worked with some really great Agile practictioners, but I came away feeling like I had my Agile Compass recalibrated!

 The instructor was David Hicks who had a great teaching technique, was very good at energising the room and broad experience of working in Agile.

The Syllabus is available on Agil8 website [here.](http://www.agil8.com/courses/Certified-Scrum-Product-Owner/) 

The main take away points for me on the course were;

1.  First Question should always be why?
2.  Agile is an Empirical Process , defining a goal and moving towards it in steps.
3.  Three pillars of Empirical Process Control - Tranparency , Inspection & Adaptation
4.  At the start of the process uncertainity is high - with each sprint it reduces
5.  It is important to stop if a product is not going to work, failing fast is one of the main benefits of the MVP process
6.  User stories should always focus on business values - even technical ones
7.  Need inspect all the time and to measure value!
8.  Value is offered by having a potentially shippable product - you don't have to ship it but you can get feedback from customers and prove ROI early.
9.  SCRUM is a mirror showing state of project from the data - removes the politics and emotions 
10.  Being a **good** product owner is hard.

The course provides the Scrum Alliance Certification [https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/profile/jgregory21](https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/profile/jgregory21 "https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/profile/jgregory21") and two years membership.

I can really recommend this course to anyone to attend. I am now relooking at all the projects I am working on with a product owner perspective and to unlearn the Agile bad habits that have formed over the last few years.
