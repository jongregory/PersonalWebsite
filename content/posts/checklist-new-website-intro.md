When starting on a new website project the focus can be on the design and functionality, this post covers seven areas of a site that I like to ensure are covered before the first sprint starts.

I work in the Agile and don't try to come up with all the solutions for these areas, but it is important to understand the functional and non-functional requirements and any restrictions. 

The seven areas are;

1. Images
2. Content
3. Payment Gateways
4. Data Migration
5. Housekeeping
6. Search
7. Security

These are have come from learnings from other projects and in most cases have caused rework or delays when they have not been considered until later in the sprints.

I started writing this as one post but it soon became large so have divided it into seven individual posts.
