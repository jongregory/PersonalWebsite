### Microsoft Certification CPD

My last Microsoft certifications were from 2008 which were based in ASP.Net forms and ADO.Net on .Net 3.5. So I was long overdue and update, the Microsoft certifications change regularly so its worth keeping an eye on the overview page [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/certification-overview.aspx](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/certification-overview.aspx)

I set myself the goal of achieving MCSD App Builder and MCSE Azure Cloud and Infrastructure, this can be achieved with five exams.

1. [70-483 Programming C#](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-483.aspx)
2. [70-486 Developing ASP.NET MVC Applications](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-486.aspx)
3. [70-532 Developing Microsoft Azure Solutions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-532.aspx)

Passing these three exams achieves [MCSD App Builder](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/mcsd-app-builder-certification.aspx). Exam 532 also counts as one of the exams for [MCSE Cloud and Platform Infrastructure](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/mcse-cloud-platform-infrastructure.aspx) so just more additional exams are then required;

1. [70-533 Implementing Azure Infrastructure Solutions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-533.aspx)
2. [70-534 Architecting Microsoft Azure Solutions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/learning/exam-70-534.aspx)

Note 70-534 is being retired and I took it in the last month of availability, it is being replaced with [70-535 Architecting Microsoft Azure Solutions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-535.aspx) which has about 30% new content.

### General Exam Tips

Here are a few tips I picked up along the way

* Try and use at least three training resources per exam, one should be the Microsoft or Azure Docs
* Each exam gives you a piece of paper, you can use this to brain dump a mental prompt sheet at the start of the exam
* Use the measureup practice exams, and review the documentation links in the answer notes to help focus on your weaker areas. They lose value after time however as you begin to memorise the answers!
* Don't be afraid to take the actual exam and fail, all of the practice tests and resources are just guides. Taking the actual exam allows you to gauge your current level of knowledge and you get a report showing you which areas to focus on.
* The 3 azure exams (532, 533, (534/535) all cover the same subject matter from a different perspective, Developer, Infrastructure and Architect. Having completed all three in hindsight I would have preferred to cover the material for all three exams as there is some overlap and it would have provided more context

### [70-483 Programming C# Resources](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-483.aspx) 

If you have been working on C# for while then this exam will cover a lot of familiar concepts, the two area I found were tricky were subjects that I don't use in everyday coding and some answers are for the Microsoft recommended way not necessarily the industry best practice.

For this exam I managed to pass using these resources;

* [Microsost Virtual Academy - Programming C#](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/programming-in-c-jump-start-14254?l=j0iuozSfB_6900115888)
* [Official Microsoft Book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Exam-Ref-70-483-Programming-MCSD/dp/0735676828?SubscriptionId=AKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q&tag=duc08-21&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0735676828)
* [MSDN C# Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
* [Measureup 483 Practice Test](http://www.measureup.com/70-483-Programming-in-C-P4220.aspx)

### [70-486 Developing ASP.NET MVC Applications Resources](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-486.aspx)

Although this Exam is for MVC certification there is a good part of Azure development in it. Specifically around debugging and security with azure.

Having worked with MVC for a few years the following resources were enough to pass, there are lots of courses available in addition to these but its important to note the exam is for MVC 5 and not .Net Core MVC.

* [Microsoft Virtual Academy - Introduction to MVC](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/introduction-to-aspnet-mvc-8322)
* [Official Microsoft Book](https://www.amazon.com/Exam-Ref-70-486-Developing-Applications/dp/0735677220)
* [MSDN ASP.Net Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/#pivot=aspnet)
* [Measureup 486 Practice Test](http://www.measureup.com/70-486-Developing-ASPNET-Web-Applications-P5134.aspx)

### [70-532 Developing Microsoft Azure Solutions Resources](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-532.aspx)

For the Azure Exams the breadth of required knowledge is much wider, the exam is very code focused and there are a good number of questions where code sections have to be completed.

I used the following resources and spent a lot longer training than the C# and MVC Exams. 

* [MVA 532 Certification Overview](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/certification-exam-overview-70532-developing-microsoft-azure-solutions-17404?l=YmdM8DmjD_506218965)
* [Ignite Exam Prep Session 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTpX4tZkYkw)
* [Udemy -  Scott Duffy - 532 Course](https://www.udemy.com/70532-azure/)
* [Azure Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/)
* [Measureup 532 Practice Test](http://www.measureup.com/Product.aspx?ProductId=5566)

I also had this Opsgility course recommended so kept it in reserve;

* [Opsgility 532 Exam Blueprint](https://www.opsgility.com/courses/player/70-532-exam-blueprint)

This exam count towards both the MCSD and MCSE certifications, once I had passed the above three exams I had earned MCSD App Builder and had the first exam towards MCSE.

### [70-533 Implementing Azure Infrastructure Solutions Resources](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-533.aspx)

This exam is focused on infrastructure and setup, which was harder for me being from a development background. Many of the questions relate to completing configuration files or Powershell cli commands to set up infrastructure.

The unfamiliarity for me was reflected in my score which was exactly the pass mark. I used to the following resources;

* [MVA 533 Certification Overview](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/certification-exam-overview-70533-implementing-microsoft-azure-infrastructure-solutions-17405?l=9TjC0QmjD_2606218965)
* [Ignite Exam Prep Session](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Ignite/2016/BRK3262)
* [Udemy - Scott Duffy - 533 Course](https://www.udemy.com/70533-azure/learn/v4/overview)
* [Azure Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/)
* [Measureup 533 Practice Test1](http://www.measureup.com/70-533-Implementing-Microsoft-Azure-Infrastructure-Solutions-P5520.aspx)
* [Microsoft Official Book (This is out of date in some areas)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/learning/exam-70-533.aspx)

I also had these courses recommended so kept it in reserve;

* [Opsgility 533](https://www.opsgility.com/CertificationTraining/Cert70533)
* [Cloud Ranger](http://www.cloudranger.net/azure-training/)
* [Linux Academy 533 Exam Prep](https://linuxacademy.com/cp/modules/view/id/123?utm_source=website&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=NewCourse_8%2F22)


### [70-534 Architecting Microsoft Azure Solutions Resources](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/learning/exam-70-534.aspx)

This exam I was told would be the hardest, however its the one I got the highest mark on, this could be due to the fact it was the last one I did and they were all closest together so I benefited from the revision for the other exams. The exam focuses on case studies and when and where to use the appropriate azure resource.

I passed on December 22nd 2017 so was a nice Christmas present and also before 534 gets replaced by the new exam 535. This is live in USA at the time of writing but not in the UK.

I  used the following  resources;

* [MVA 534 Certification Overview](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/certification-exam-overview-70534-architecting-microsoft-azure-solutions-17406?l=HvO3aUmjD_1906218965)
