Solved two problems - maintaining a large book mark collection across multiple devices and accounts. And saving articles I found when time limited but wanted to read later.

Use small amounts of time in a day to browse articles on phone and save to pocket

Can use share with or copy url and open app and paste

Browser plugin to save and tag articles 

Access the queue to read articles at quieter times during the day. Can delete or archive with tags for future reference.
