I have doing this personal blog for a couple of years now, I have always wanted it to be a personal log of things I was looking at the time rather than a promotional blog. Its easy to lose momentum when other commitments pile up so below are a few tips I found to keep going;



1. **Easy to use Tooling** make sure the blog is easy to use and maintainable, I started out with BlogEngine.net but switched to Hugo on Netlify with files in GitHub and find it much easier.
2. **Accessible** to make best use of my time I can have the git repo for my blog on multiple machines, so when I get small windows of time available I can get a post down and committed. 
3. **Use Source control** being a coder using source control is a daily activity so for the blog I can use branching, synchronise across multiple machines and track versions.
4. **Roadmap** - having a roadmap of posts and things to look at keeps momentum and helps you pick up where you left.
5. **Think about what you know** - Taking a few minutes to look back on what you have been working on or reading about can help generate some blog post ideas. 
6. **Use it as a driver** to explore tech and ideas your interested in, writing a blog post can be great driver to explore something and record your findings. 
7. **Use it as a journal** recording what your thoughts and findings can be a great future reference and memory aid.
8. **Retrospective** Having a personal blog means your able to look back and review what you where thinking, remind you of any learnings or being able to refocus on core goals such as certifications.
9. **Portfolio** As a back end enterprise developer it difficult to have a portfolio of your work, especially if its on proprietary applications. Side projects are a great way to demonstrate knowledge but can take a lot of work to maintain. A personal blog can act as a portfolio of skills, thoughts and interests over time and act as a CPD record too.
