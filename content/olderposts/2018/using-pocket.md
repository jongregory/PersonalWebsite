I am really interested in productivity tools and techniques that help me make the best use of my time. 

I had noticed two problems I had formed recently, the first being the huge bookmark collection I had gathered in Chrome which was unusable. 

The second issue was I was finding articles and resources I wanted to read in small pockets of time during the day, emailing them to work and ending up with a backlog of reading I never got through. I covered some of this approach of emailing content to work a couple of years ago in the post [Being a Digital Squirrel](https://www.jongregory.net/posts/being-a-digital-squirrel/)

I started looking for a solution to this and decided upon [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/), this solved both problems by allowing me to save and organise my bookmarks into pocket and empty out the chrome bookmark manager. Because links can be tagged I can organise the links and access them quickly when researching a topic.

The second problem is where I have found the real benefit, because [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) has a chrome plugin and mobile apps I can save urls to my queue quickly from any of my devices. Pocket appears as a share option in most of the android apps, or if you copy a url and then open the Pocket app it prompts you to save it to your queue.

The articles are placed in a queue in the pocket website where I can review on a lunchtime, and chose to archive for future reference or delete.

So far I have only used the free service and found it meets all my needs, I have been able to stay on top of my reading the last few weeks and can actually access any resources I need quickly. I no longer have half the technical content of the internet book marked either!
