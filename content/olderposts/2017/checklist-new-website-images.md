### Images

Images are crucial for any modern website, however I have sometimes found the process for managing the images and matching to content on the website can be overlooked. Some questions I always try and ask in the early stages of a new website project are;

1. *Where are images sourced from*, is there an image management tool or are they manually uploaded? 
2. *How will the images be refreshed?* If they are being sourced from an external source what is the latency and can then by loaded into a CDN?
3. *Matching up to the content* - How will the images be matched to the location in the content, multiple product images for example. Can a naming convention be used and how should a missing image be handled gracefully?
4. *Size and Optimisation* - What format will the images be supplied in, do they need to be resized or optimised automatically automatically?
5. *Can a convention* be put in place to manage multiple images.
6. *Fail Gracefully* - what happens when an image is not present - how are the content managers alerted?
