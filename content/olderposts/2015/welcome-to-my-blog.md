Welcome to my blog! After many years consuming blogged information and finding it invaluable in my professional career I felt it was about time I blogged myself.

I have worked in IT for 15 years and recently moved from a development to technical architecture role. During my career I have been fortunate enough to work on Mainframes, Oracle & Unix and for the last seven years on .NET both web, windows and server side applications.

This blog will hopefully be a mix of coding challenges, useful resources and my experiences trying to develop and improve my architecture skills.
